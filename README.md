₿ Bitcoin Price Predictor 📈

A comprehensive machine learning application for forecasting short-term Bitcoin (BTC-USD) price movements using time-series analysis and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

This project demonstrates the application of traditional Machine Learning models to financial time-series data, specifically focusing on the volatile cryptocurrency market.

🚀 Features & Highlights

💡 Predictive Modeling: Employs a Linear Regression model (easily swappable with Random Forest or XGBoost) trained on historical data.

💻 Interactive UI: Powered by Streamlit (app.py), allowing users to adjust the data period (30d, 1y, etc.) and prediction horizon (1-24 hours).

📊 Technical Analysis: Calculates essential indicators like Moving Averages (MA) and various time-series features to enhance prediction accuracy.

🔮 Future Forecasting: Generates and visualizes short-term price predictions, showing price changes and model confidence metrics (RMSE, R²).

✅ Test Coverage: Includes a simple unit test file (test_case.py) to validate data processing logic.

📦 Installation

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Bitcoin-Price-Predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/Bitcoin-Price-Predictor.git)
cd Bitcoin-Price-Predictor



Install dependencies:
The project requires several popular Python libraries, including Streamlit for the UI and yfinance for data fetching.

pip install -r requirements.txt



▶️ Usage

You can run the prediction logic either through the command line (for quick testing) or via the interactive web interface.

1. Web Interface (Recommended)

Run the Streamlit app to access the full interactive dashboard:

streamlit run app.py



This will automatically open the web application in your default browser, where you can configure the prediction settings.

2. Command Line Interface

Run the core prediction script directly to see the results and Matplotlib charts:

python main.py



(This defaults to analyzing 60 days of hourly data and predicting the next 5 hours.)

🧠 Project Structure

The codebase is organized into modular files for clarity and maintainability:

app.py: The main Streamlit file defining the UI, controls, and visualizations.

main.py: Contains the core logic: data fetching, technical indicator calculation, and the machine learning model training/prediction functions.

requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python package dependencies.

test_case.py: Unit tests for data preparation and feature engineering functions.
